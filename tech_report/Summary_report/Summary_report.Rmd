abstract: Abstracts should be up to 300 words and provide a succinct summary of the article. Although the abstract should explain why the article might be interesting, care should be taken not to inappropriately over-emphasise the importance of the work described in the article. Citations should not be used in the abstract, and the use of abbreviations should be minimized.

# Introduction

The introduction provides context as to why the software tool was developed and what need it addresses.  It is good scholarly practice to mention previously developed tools that address similar needs, and why the current tool is needed.

# Methods

## Quality control

## Alignment and expression quantification

## Differential expression analysis

## 


# Results <!-- Optional - only if novel data or analyses are included -->
This section is only required if the paper includes novel data or analyses, and should be written as a traditional results section.



# Summary <!-- Optional - only if NO new datasets are included -->
This section is required if the paper does not include novel data or analyses.  It allows authors to briefly summarize the key points from the article.

# Data availability <!-- Optional - only if novel data or analyses are included -->
Please add details of where any datasets that are mentioned in the paper, and that have not have not previously been formally published, can be found.  If previously published datasets are mentioned, these should be cited in the references, as per usual scholarly conventions.

# Software availability
This section will be generated by the Editorial Office before publication. Authors are asked to provide some initial information to assist the Editorial Office, as detailed below.

1. URL link to where the software can be downloaded from or used by a non-coder (AUTHOR TO PROVIDE; optional)
2. URL link to the author's version control system repository containing the source code (AUTHOR TO PROVIDE; required)
3. Link to source code as at time of publication (*F1000Research* TO GENERATE)
4. Link to archived source code as at time of publication (*F1000Research* TO GENERATE)
5. Software license (AUTHOR TO PROVIDE; required)

For each funder, please state the funderâ€™s name, the grant number where applicable, and the individual to whom the grant was assigned. If your work was not funded by any grants, please include the line: 'The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.'

# Acknowledgments
This section should acknowledge anyone who contributed to the research or the article but who does not qualify as an author based on the criteria provided earlier (e.g. someone or an organization that provided writing assistance). Please state how they contributed; authors should obtain permission to acknowledge from all those mentioned in the Acknowledgments section.


<!-- If you specify a figure caption to a code chunk using the chunk option `fig.cap`, the plot will be automatically labeled and numbered. The figure label is generated from the label of the code chunk by prefixing it with `fig:`, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:plot). -->

<!-- ```{r plot, out.width='60%', fig.cap='A caption to our sample plot.'} -->
<!-- plot(x) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Tables -->

<!-- Markdown syntax tends to lack some of the more sophisticated formatting features available in LaTeX, so you may need to edit the tables later to get the desired format. -->

<!-- | First name  | Last Name | Grade | -->
<!-- | ----------- | --------- | ----- | -->
<!-- | John        | Doe       |   7.5 | -->
<!-- | Richard     | Miles     |     2 | -->

<!-- Table: Caption to table. -->

<!-- Just like figures, tables with captions will also be numbered and can be referenced. Captions are entered as a paragraph beginning with the string "Table:" (or just ":"), which may appear either before or after the table. A label for the table should appear in the beginning of the caption in the form of `(\#tab:label)`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:table). -->

<!-- : (\#tab:table) A table with text justification. -->

<!-- | First name  | Last Name | Grade | -->
<!-- | ----------- | :-------: | ----: | -->
<!-- | John        | Doe       |   7.5 | -->
<!-- | Richard     | Miles     |     2 | -->

<!-- ## Figures -->

<!-- You can include static figures (i.e. no generated by code) using the `include_graphics()` function from the **knitr** package, in a standard code chunk. -->

<!-- ```{r frog-picture, out.width='50%', fig.cap = 'Your figure legend goes here; it should be succinct, while still explaining all symbols and abbreviations.'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics('frog.jpg') -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can again use the `fig.cap` option to provide the figure caption, and reference the image based on the code chunk label.  You can also use options such as `fig.align` and `fig.width` to adjust the position and size of the image within the final document, e.g. Figure \@ref(fig:frog-picture) is a frog. -->
